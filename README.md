# tsc-runtime-type-benchmarks

## Goal

like https://github.com/moltar/typescript-runtime-type-benchmarks` but for tsc
speed instead of runtime speed

## Install

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running tests

```bash
## generate all API clients
## unfortunately, they suck
bun run main.ts
```

```bash
## run tsc
## unfortunately, API clients have TS errors so this ruins the entire thing
bun run:all
```

## Results

TODO (probably never, was a nice try)
